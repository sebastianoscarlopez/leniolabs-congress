# [Leniolabs-Congress Challenge on Github Pages](https://sebastianoscarlopez.github.io/leniolabs-congress/)

# Task Definition
Create a project using create-react-app and implement a list of congress members.

You should read and implement the ProPublica Congress API:

https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/#lists-of-members.

# Functional Requirements:
Add a header and footer
Create a list with congress persons.
Use SCSS to style the list.
Add a input to search through all the fields name, party, gender, etc.
Add a toggle button to display advanced filter to search by each field
Add routing to implement a detail view

# Optionals
Client side pagination (size=7)
Add responsive features
Deploy the application using github pages/heroku
Add a back button on the detail view.
Add a range filter by date.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
